* This is just the quick and dirty implementation of a SQLite program to keep tabs on inventory at work. 
* Originally wrote in python, I've since re-wrote in Golang and now in Java as a learning experience. 
* This is going to be used full time, on the job though, so I will be polishing this up over the coming weeks.
